This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
# or
next build
```

## Third-party libraries

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - axios is easier to use than fetch() to make api calls.
- [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) - simple and low size library used to format the date on post.
